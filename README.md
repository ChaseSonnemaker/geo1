# swing
A project for CSC 144 at Cornell College based around 2D and 3D image creation. Much of this code was originally forked from Leon Tabak my professor. This program creates a window that shows an animated rotating shaded regular prism. The color of the background, color of the shape, number of sides of the main faces, width of the shape, speed of the rotation, and axis of rotation can all be manipulated using menus in the window. Despite me considering this project finished there are still some issues still occurring in this project that I could never quite figure out. For example, the menus are created using a HashMaps which allow for more complicated and specified menus; however, as a result, menus that should be ordered by a number are out of order which is not user friendly. I attempted making a sorting algorithm for these lists but they never worked as intended. Another issue that continues to occur is the prisms with smaller widths and a smaller number of sides sometimes paint prism triangles that should be hidden after painting foreground triangles, leading to some slightly disjointed animations. This is likely due to my method of ordering based on the smallest z-axis coordinate in the triangle. The issue is mostly fixed when using a larger number of sides or a larger width.
